# PDFDL


## *Created by Jessica Bakare* 

A program that searches a given website for pdf links and downloads all pdfs found to a given directory. Has a GUI, so command
line isn't needed to run it. 

How to use: When program starts, choose the directory you want to save the file(s) to (make sure to double click!),
then minimize and unminimize the window and enter the website's url. Then press "Start!" button.
